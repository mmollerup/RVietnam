<!-- ## The origin of R -->
<!-- - R is a language and environment for statistical computing and for graphics -->
<!-- - GNU project (100% free software) -->
<!-- - Managed by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria. -->
<!-- - Community-driven -->
<!-- - Based on the object-oriented language S (1975) -->


## What is R?

- R is a programming language for statistical programming and graphics
- Opensource, powered by *the R Foundation for Statistical Computing*
- Driven by a volunteer community that develops packages for every imaginable purpose


## What is Tidyverse? 

- A collection of data management, modeling, and visualization packages that "share underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures"
- Characterized by the use of so-called "pipes", where the output of each line's code is passed on to the next link in the pipe. This generally makes for more readable code.
```{r echo=F, out.width='50%', out.extra='style="float:right; padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics("figuresLecture/tidyverse.png")
```
- Load with `library(tidyverse)`

<!-- - Karakteriseret ved brug af såkaldte "pipes", hvor output af hver linjes kode sendes videre til næste led i pipen. Dette giver generelt lettere læselig kode. -->
<!-- ```{r echo=F, out.width='50%', out.extra='style="float:right; padding:10px"'} -->
<!-- knitr::include_graphics("figurer/tidyverse.png") -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- - Indlæs med `library(tidyverse)` -->


# What is RStudio?

## Integrated Development Environment

## RStudio
- Aggregates all convenient information and procedures into one single place
- Allows you to work in projects
- Manages your code with highlighting
- Gives extra functionality (Shiny, knitr, markdown, LaTeX)
- Allows for integration with version control routines, such as Git.

# How does R work

## Objects and elements
- R works with objects that consist of elements. The smallest elements are numbers and characters.

    - These elements are assigned to objects. 
    - A set of objects can be used to perform calculations
    - Calculations can be presented as functions
    - Functions are used to perform calculations and return new objects, containing calculated (or estimated) elements. 

## The help
- Everything that is published on the Comprehensive `R` Archive Network (CRAN) and is aimed at `R` users, must be accompanied by a help file. 
- If you know the name of the function that performs an operation, e.g. `anova()`, then you just type `?anova` or `help(anova)` in the console. 
- If you do not know the name of the function: type `??` followed by your search criterion. For example `??anova` returns a list of all help pages that contain the word 'anova'

- Alternatively, the internet will tell you almost everything you'd like to know (and then some)

- Sites such as http://www.stackoverflow.com and http://www.stackexchange.com, as well as `Google` can be of tremendous help. 
    - If you google `R` related issues; use 'R:' as a prefix in your search term
    
## Assigning elements to objects
- Assigning things in R is very straightforward: 

    - you just use `<-`

- For example, if you assign the value `100` (an element) to object `a`, you would type

```{r}
a <- 100
```

- Life hack: In RStudio learn to use the shortcut "alt + -" (hyphen) to produce the left arrow `<-` in an R file


## Calling objects
- Calling things in R is also very straightforward: 

    - you just use type the name you have given to the object

- For example, we assigned the value `100` to object `a`. To call object `a`, we would type

```{r}
a
```
